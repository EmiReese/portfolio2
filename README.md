This portfolio is a collection of the work I have created with other collaborators. In the description below, I have a short summary of each project and the technologies that were used. I added the collaborators github accounts at the bottom of the description. 

My portfolio was created using:

- Node.js
- Apollo Client
- Dotenv
- Bootstrap
- Images from Unsplash


In this portfolio, I have three different projects.

  Virtual Pets- 
    This is a full-stack application intended to help pet parents make Telehealth consultation appointments with Veterinarians and    post questions to an open forum. This was created by four student developers in one week at the Georgia Institute of Technology. 

Technologies used: JavaScript, SQL, Handlebars, Node.js, ESLint, Dotenv, Express.js Sequelize, and Materalize 

My contribution is on the front end of this application. I used Handlebars to create the structure of our application. I created the logic and design for four of our main pages using Handlebars, Javascript, and Materialize.

  HandyCart- 
  
    This is a retail purchasing application leveraging contact list technology and financial budget parameters. This project was created by four student developers within one week at the Georgia Institute of Technology. 

This is MERN full-stack application leveraging the following technologies: Javascript, React.js, Node.js, Apollo-Server-Express, GraphQL.js, Mongoose, Tailwind CSS, GitHub, vsCode, Heroku, Bcrypt, and MongoDB Atlas

My contribution to this project included the logic and design of the login-in/sign-up pages, the home page, and the profile page. I added routes and authentication.This is a retail purchasing application leveraging contact list technology and financial budget parameters.

  ChairtyLocator- 
    This application was created in one week by four student developers at the Georgia Institute of Technology. 
An application intended to help underprivileged people or families connect to non-profit organizations closest to their location with resources such as food, clothing, and shelter. 
We use the Charity Navigator Data API to help us search for charities that are closest to the location the user puts into the search bar. We use the Geocoding API to turn the addresses into geographic coordinates. These geographic coordinates are used to find the exact location of these organizations and display the results on Google Map using the Maps Javascript API. 

Technologies used: vsCode, Figma, JavaScript, Charity Navigator Data API, Maps Javascript API, Geocoding API, Bootstrap, and Materialize

My contribution to this project was the setup of the Geocoding API, the Maps Javascript API, and the CSS design using Bootstrap and Materialize.
